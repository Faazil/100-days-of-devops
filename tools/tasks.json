    "description": "The Nautilus DevOps team had a discussion about, how they can train different team members to use Ansible for different automation tasks. There are numerous ways to perform a particular task using Ansible, but we want to utilize each aspect that Ansible offers. The team wants to utilise Ansible's conditionals to perform the following task: An inventory file is already placed under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host, with all the Stratos DC app servers included. Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml and make sure to use Ansible's when conditionals statements to perform the below given tasks.",

    "description": "The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process. - Create a VPC named `devops-vpc` in region `us-east-1` with any `IPv4 CIDR` block through terraform. - The Terraform working directory is `/home/bob/terraform`. Create the `main.tf` file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.",

IAM facilitates the creation and management of user accounts, groups, roles, policies, and other access controls. The Nautilus DevOps team is currently in the process of configuring these resources and has outlined the following requirements. Create an IAM policy named `iampolicy_ravi` in `us-east-1` region using Terraform. It must allow read-only access to the `EC2 console`, i.e., this policy must allow users to view `all instances`, `AMIs`, and `snapshots` in the Amazon EC2 console.

This instance should be accessible only from within the VPC, allowing for secure communication and resource management within the AWS environment. 1. Create a VPC named `datacenter-priv-vpc` with the CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16`. 2. Create a subnet named `datacenter-priv-subnet` inside the VPC with the CIDR block `10.0.1.0/24` and auto-assign IP option must not be enabled.",
